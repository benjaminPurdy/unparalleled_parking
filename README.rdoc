So desided to setup a new Amazon EC2 elastic server in the cloud and install LAMP setup on it. Then got Ruby on Rails up and running using a lightweight splite3 database in the background to write a custom folder system using ajax calls for most of it, but not using ajax for creating a new folder (just got lazy at that point in time). Think this is probably more than you were asking for but if not cool. Naturally i rushed through this so I'm guessing that i missed some small bugs and it really bothers me that I havent written unit tests for this =/. Just kinda plowed through it instead. 

Hope you enjoy,
Ben
