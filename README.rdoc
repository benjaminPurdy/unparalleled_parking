== README

So desided to setup a new Amazon EC2 elastic server in the cloud and install LAMP setup on it. Then got Ruby on Rails up and running using a lightweight splite3 database in the background to write a custom folder system using ajax calls for most of it, but not using ajax for creating a new folder (just got lazy at that point in time). Think this is probably more than you were asking for but if not cool. Naturally i rushed through this so I'm guessing that i missed some small bugs and it really bothers me that I havent written unit tests for this =/. Just kinda plowed through it instead. 


Items i would have liked to do:
   Create a dev through prod specific yamall file for database configurations
   Installed bootstrap and configured the UI
   More thuroly test behavior if multiple users are on it.
   Add Tests
   Clean up code (curently the database row names and what im using them for dont make the most sense), also not utilizing helper methods as I should
 
Hope you enjoy,
Ben
